# Step-by-step publishing guide for Site templates

Thank you for your decision to contribute to our Template market!

With our recommended flow, you'll start with just an idea and end up with a paid Instant Site template available to all Ecwid users worldwide!

### Sign up with Ecwid

Start your journey by submitting a new dev form from the following link: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request)

Specify that you are working on a template, leave some contact details, and share some of your existing projects/apps here.

Our App team will review the form shortly and contact you by email.

### Get a dev store and a dev app

After getting approval from the App team, you'll receive a follow-up email telling you how to set up a dev environment with Ecwid. You'll only need to register a free Ecwid store and share its ID with us.

Then API Support team will provide you with the dev app and a free premium plan for your store.

### Jump to the quickstart section

Now you can start working on the project.

Set up a fully working template in your store with our [Quickstart guide](../develop-site-templates/quickstart-guide-to-a-working-site-template.md). From this point, you have full control over the template code and check any changes live in the Instant Site Editor â€“ a website editor tool integrated into Ecwid store admin.

### Check your app before submission

* Test the template in your store on both desktop and mobile versions.
* Ensure your app meets technical requirements for public templates.
* Check out recommendations for building public template apps.

### Submit your template

With the templates ready, prepare promo materials for publishing and submit your template app to the review process performed by our Apps team: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form)

Apps team will reach out back to you in 1-2 working days.
