# Requirements for public Site templates

All Site templates built for publishing must meet the list of requirements described below before submitting for technical review.

### Text localization

**Lightspeed eCom (Ecwid)** officially supports **English**, **French**, and **Dutch** languages. Although more languages are available in the control panel of E-Series, you are only required to keep your localization requirements for three official languages:

* The main dev store for developing templates must be in **English**.
* Any documentation provided with the template must be available in official languages.
* The description of the template or any non-name words inside the template name must be available in official languages.
* All settings for your custom sections users can see in Instant Site Editor must be available in the three official languages.
* Any major updates to the template should be referenced in a changelog available in official languages. The changelog can be published on your side or in the template description visible in the website editor.
* When displaying product prices, templates must use the correct currency symbol or currency code and support any active advanced discounts and "Compare to" prices.

{% endhint %}

### Storefront availability

Requirements for website design ensure Ecwid users do not miss website functionality and their customers can navigate storefronts without problems.

* The following storefront elements must be available directly or through the menu on all pages: Cart icon, Search bar, "Sign in" link, Legal Pages links, and supported languages list/selector.
* All storefront elements should have sufficient contrast â€” 4.5:1 or better as per W3C AA standards.
* All storefront elements must be properly aligned.
* Any text fields added by the template must be able to handle long text values.
* The website design must be responsive and optimized for mobile view: button and text sizes should adjust automatically to make mobile navigation easier.

If the app has several templates, every template must:

* Use different color palettes.
* Have a configured navigation bar with working links (categories, website sections).
* Use some of your custom sections. In total, all of your custom sections must be used in at least one template file.
* Have its own preview store, where merchants can check its feels and looks.

### Instant Site Editor

Requirements for the Instant Site Editor ensure that users have great UX while building websites:

* All settings have titles, descriptions, and placeholder texts where possible. Such texts should explain the setting clearly and in a detailed manner.
* All colors in section settings must be customizable through section design settings.
* Design and content settings inside your section should have a clear outline and categorization.
* If the app has several templates, every template must have a clear screenshot for the Instant Site Editor listing (`cover_image` attribute inside the template file).

### Storefront performance

All templates must meet performance requirements to ensure applying the template doesn't slow down the website.

* All sections used in the template must be W3C validated. Link to the validator: [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Google PageSpeed score should be **above 70**, preferably in the **Pass** category. Link to the PageSpeed Insights: [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* The template and its sections must not cause any errors in the browser console upon rendering. This includes warning messages on JS or HTML errors.
* If the template adds structured data, there should not be any Google Structured Data errors in it. Link to the Structured Data test tools: [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data)
