# Technical guide for publishing Site themes

Thank you for your decision to contribute to our Themes market!

With our recommended flow, you'll start with just an idea and end up with a monetized Instant Site theme available to all Ecwid users worldwide!

### Sign up with Ecwid

Start your journey by submitting a new dev form from the following link: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request)

Specify that you are working on a theme, leave some contact details, and share some of your existing projects/apps here.

Our App team will review the form shortly and contact you by email.

### Set up dev environment

After getting approval from the App team, you'll receive a follow-up email telling you how to set up a dev environment with Ecwid. You'll only need to register a free Ecwid store and share its ID with us.

Ecwid Apps team will provide you with the **dev app** and a **free premium plan for your store**.

### Go through design requirements and guidelines

Site themes are all about the design and aesthetics.

To ensure the quality of public themes available in Ecwid Theme market, we prepared guidelines, internal and external inspiration resources, and a self-review checklist to help you on your journey.

Be sure to check the [Broken link](/broken/pages/Zvukm7MAGL6ooitMTmpY "mention") section before starting coding!

### Jump to the quickstart section

Now you can start working on the project: [quickstart-with-a-site-theme-example.md](../develop-site-themes/quickstart-with-a-site-theme-example.md "mention")

From this point, you have full control over the theme code. Push and instantly check any changes to your theme with the Instant Site editor – a website editor tool integrated into Ecwid store admin.

### Check your app before submission

When you feel like your theme is ready for launch, make a simple self-review using the provided checklist and adjust the theme to pass all of the requirements outlined there: [checklist-for-public-site-themes.md](checklist-for-public-site-themes.md "mention")

### Submit your theme

With the themes ready, prepare promo materials for publishing and submit your theme to the review process performed by our Apps team: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form)
