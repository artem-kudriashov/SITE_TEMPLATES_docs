# How to use sections without Site templates

Any page on any Ecwid website is built from **sections**. When you create a Site template, you basically build a one-column page couple from **Custom sections** whose order is specified in the template file. &#x20;

However, custom sections can be used on their own, without a template, thus allowing you to add new functionality and enhance the website's look without rebuilding it from scratch.&#x20;

### Create a project with sections without Site templates&#x20;

When you start working on a site customization project, you can skip importing template files. In that case, all custom sections will become available in the Editor.

Find detailed instructions in the [Quickstart guide for building sections](quickstart-with-custom-sections-without-building-site-templates.md).

### Use Custom sections in the Editor

When your project doesn't have template files, its custom sections can be freely used in the website editor.

To see all available custom sections, in the editor, click <kbd>**+ Add section**</kbd>**,** then click on the **Sections from App Market** in the left menu:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/custom_sections_editor.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Custom sections, when built without a template, are always available in the editor, even if a user applied a custom Site template.

### Learn project structure without templates

The diagram below shows the folder structure of a project with one custom section:

```mermaid fullWidth="true"
block-beta
  columns 15
  z["Crane project folder"]:15
  a["Crane app"]:13
  b["node_modules"]
  style b fill:#696
  c["packages"]
  style c fill:#696
  d["sections"]:12
  f["packages"]
  space:2
  l["assets"]
  m["component"]
  n["entity"]
  o["settings"]:3
  p["showcases"]:2
  q["client.ts"]
  style q fill:#696
  r["server.ts"]
  style r fill:#696
  k["type.ts"]
  style k fill:#696
  i["Section.vue"]
  style i fill:yellow
  x["crane-config.json"]
  style x fill:yellow
  space:5
  gg["content.ts"]
  ff["design.ts"]
  dd["translations.ts"]
  style gg fill:yellow
  style ff fill:yellow
  style dd fill:yellow
  ss["1.ts"]
  style ss fill:yellow
  aa["translations.ts"]
  style aa fill:yellow
```

Files and folders marked as <mark style="background-color:green;">**green**</mark> are internal; they shouldn't be touched.

Files marked with the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**yellow**</mark> color are the ones you interact with:

* **../packages/crane-config.json** contains keys from your Ecwid app required for deploying the project.
* **../Section.vue** is the main file with the code that builds a section on the storefront.
* **../settings/content.ts** contains the content settings visible to the store owner in the Site editor. For example, such settings allow changing texts and images in the section.
* **../settings/design.ts** contains the design settings allowing the store owner to customize the content's colors, fonts, etc.
* **../settings/translations.ts** contains texts and translations for content and design settings visible in the Site editor.
* **../showcases/1.ts** sets content/design settings to define how the section preview looks. If you want to add multiple showcases for your section, add more files to the same folder. For example, **../2.ts**.
* **../showcases/translations.ts** contains texts and translations for the showcase files.

We recommend getting an Ecwid-built example section and using it to learn all the file and code dependencies.

### Start building sections

Now that you know how custom sections can work without templates, jump into building your own sections:
