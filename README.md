# Introduction to Site themes development

With Ecwid, you can build a website tailored to your business needs, whether or not they require an online store. The website builder called **Instant Site** offers many tools for creating a truly unique multipage and multilingual site. Read more about its built-in features in the [Help Center](https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/207100069-What-is-Instant-Site).

If you want to customize your website even more, you can use dev tools to build **Site themes** or **Sections:**

* **Site themes** allow you to completely overhaul your website's look and feel. Or even offer website designs to all Instant Site users through the theme market. Get started easily with the [quickstart-with-a-site-theme-example.md](develop-site-themes/quickstart-with-a-site-theme-example.md "mention")
* **Sections** are building blocks for any Instant Site page. You can create **custom sections** that can be used as a part of a Site theme or as a standalone customization, for example, an animated product promo card.

Incorporate any features and designs into templates, focusing on specific business niches or use cases. For example, add custom widgets, third-party integrations, and unique layouts that are unavailable within the default functionality.

The themes in the market are offered as a paid feature, giving you the chance to earn money from your efforts. Ecwid handles all billing and distribution, allowing you to stay focused on your work. [Broken link](/broken/pages/2v05Nufe5t3VYzcP8NqB "mention")
