# Step-by-step guide for building a theme design

Creating a great website theme is all about **design and aesthetics**. As a theme developer, you must refine your design system before jumping into the coding. This way, you'll get a much more consistent and successful theme in the end.&#x20;

### Step 1. Define the vertical(s)

Decide which vertical(s) your theme should support — with primary focus on Apparel & Footwear, Sports & Outdoor, Vape & Smoke, Bike, and Golf, and optional support for Wine & Liquor, Home & Garden, Jewelry & Accessories, Pet, and other verticals as needed.

### Step 2. Decide on the content strategy

Before applying any rules, decide which one of the content strategies your theme will use:

*   **Brand-driven narratives** that use rich, expressive storytelling to create a vivid sense of identity and atmosphere. \
    \
    They show how the theme performs when filled with immersive, cohesive brand content. The goal is to present a believable “mini-brand” that sells through mood and character.\
    \
    Do:

    * Build a coherent narrative world, complete with values, history, voice, or mood.
    * Use expressive language that enhances the aesthetic.
    * Add brand details to the text when it feels appropriate.

    Don’t:

    * Lock the theme into a single industry niche.
    * Mix unrelated tones or break narrative consistency.
*   **Brand-independent narratives** stay broadly compatible with any brand, as they don’t construct a specific brand reality. The text should be coherent on its own, yet easy to replace. The goal is to illustrate theme structure using neutral, functional texts.\
    \
    Do:

    * Keep language simple, neutral, and brand-agnostic.
    * Use content that illustrates the type of information a merchant might place there without leaning into brand specifics or a distinct brand-focused tone of voice.
    * Use placeholders like “your company” instead of a brand name if needed.

    Don’t:

    * Use directive placeholders (“Add headline,” “Describe your product”).
    * Fill space with texts like “Lorem ipsum.”

### Step 3. Create the pseudo-brand (if applicable)

If you choose a brand-driven narrative, your theme will need a consistent style and a story to encourage users try it out. We recommend the following approach to creating such a brand:

* Define category/vertical and matching tone of voice for your brand.
* Fill in the texts: choose a name for your brand and add a short description.
*   Choose the logo format (text or visual).\
    \
    If it's a **visual logo**, generate a demo one. Check the following examples for inspiration: [LogoArchive](https://www.logo-archive.org/), [bpando.org](http://bpando.org/), [Namelix](https://namelix.com/), [brandmark.io](http://brandmark.io) <br>

    If it's a **text logo**, we recommend picking one of the following font styles:

    * Minimal/Quiet: clean text-only wordmark.
    * Lifestyle/Soft: gentle serif or soft sans.
    * Playful/Experimental: expressive or characterful wordmark.

    Creating your brand logo early helps maintain consistency in demo content and ensures the theme's header and hero layout are designed appropriately. \
    \
    Do not forget about a favicon. It can be based on the logo, use the first letter of the brand name, or even be a simple icon without any text.

### Step 4. Define product showcases

Now that you have your content strategy (and a brand demo if applicable), choose how you would like to showcase usage of your theme. Choose the products your theme will demonstrate by default.

You can use real photos or generated illustrations/images, but whatever you choose must fit the aesthetic. Use sources like: [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/), [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/), [https://www.lummi.ai](https://www.lummi.ai) for photos, or [https://nanabanana.ai/](https://nanabanana.ai/) for generated content.

### Step 5. Choose the aesthetic style

We encourage you to build modern themes with their own mood and unique style.&#x20;

To help you with this task, we prepared detailed recommendations on aesthetic choices and a pattern library for any visual elements you might need.

Use the [Aesthetic Spectrum](resources/aesthetic-spectrum.md) + [Pattern Library](resources/pattern-library.md) for inspiration to pick the style direction: Quiet Luxury, Soft Lifestyle, Editorial, Confident DTC, Cinematic, Playful, Brutalist/Experimental, etc.

Review references and save 2–3 key websites that match the desired mood. Working with references can be a quick and easy way to choose the good design direction for a future template.&#x20;

### Step 6. Define the theme structure

Outline the full template structure, for example:

* Hero
* Product grid
* Collection blocks
* Value/benefits
* Reviews
* Story/about block
* Footer

We recommend checking out Selling Ability guidelines to shape a clear, conversion-friendly flow. Add draft demo text for each section.

This structure will be later used to build specific sections of your theme.
{% endhint %}

### Step 7. Build the color palette

To create a modern and stylish theme, you need to:

* Define the 6-color palette: Lightest, Light, Soft Accent, Strong Accent, Dark, Darkest.
* Decide which color schemes are used for each section and whether your theme should support light/dark/accented modes.

### 8. Select imagery for the theme

Choose or generate images that support the chosen style. Images may come before or after color selection — both approaches work, as long as they harmonize.

Use sources [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/), [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/), [https://www.lummi.ai](https://www.lummi.ai)  or generate [https://nanabanana.ai/](https://nanabanana.ai/)

### 9. Assemble the theme

Place structure + text + images + palette. Refine spacing, hierarchy, rhythm, and visual cohesion. Compare your result with the 2–3 reference sites chosen earlier.

### 10. Run a final quality check

Before calling the theme complete, review it using the [Short Template Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9zcGZk6tVhgX9T4QtdU0y-qwZdy1NQxfNGfsVfM69E/edit?tab=t.lpues2lsnlna).

It will help you quickly verify:

* content stability,
* visual quality,
* color-system compatibility,
* and basic selling ability.

If all checklist points pass, the template is ready for internal review or handoff.
