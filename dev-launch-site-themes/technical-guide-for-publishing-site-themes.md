# Technical guide for publishing Site themes

Thank you for your decision to contribute to our Themes market!

With our recommended flow, you'll start with just an idea and end up with a paid Instant Site theme available to all Ecwid users worldwide!

### Sign up with Ecwid

Start your journey by submitting a new dev form from the following link: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request)

Specify that you are working on a theme, leave some contact details, and share some of your existing projects/apps here.

Our App team will review the form shortly and contact you by email.

### Get a dev store and a dev app

After getting approval from the App team, you'll receive a follow-up email telling you how to set up a dev environment with Ecwid. You'll only need to register a free Ecwid store and share its ID with us.

Then API Support team will provide you with the dev app and a free premium plan for your store.

### Jump to the quickstart section

Now you can start working on the project.

Set up a fully working theme in your store with our [Quickstart guide](../develop-site-themes/quickstart-with-a-site-theme-example.md). From this point, you have full control over the theme code and check any changes live in the Instant Site Editor – a website editor tool integrated into Ecwid store admin.

### Check your app before submission

* Test the theme in your store across both desktop and mobile.
* Self-review your theme to ensure it meets our minimum technical and design requirements: [checklist-for-public-site-themes.md](checklist-for-public-site-themes.md "mention")
* Adjust your theme if needed to complete the checklist.

### Submit your theme

With the themes ready, prepare promo materials for publishing and submit your theme to the review process performed by our Apps team: [https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-readiness-form)

Ecwid Apps team will reach back to you in 1-2 working days.
