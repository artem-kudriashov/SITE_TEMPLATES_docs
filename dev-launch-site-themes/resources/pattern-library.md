# Pattern Library

**Pattern Library** collects recurring visual techniques, layout ideas, and stylistic moves found across high-quality modern websites.

It should help you explore proven, contemporary patterns within different aesthetic directions: from quiet minimalism to expressive experimental design.

Not to copy, but to inspire. Use this library to create your own unique style for themes:

* to understand what makes each aesthetic spectrum feel authentic and modern,
* to find visual approaches that fit a chosen spectrum,
* to discover compositional tricks, typography styles, or layout structures that elevate themes,
* to avoid outdated design solutions by using fresher, more relevant patterns.

Review and utilise the patterns below to create themes that feel intentional, current, and competitive.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Don’t hesitate to borrow ideas, even if you’re not a designer! Taking a few solutions from different sources and combining them thoughtfully already creates a strong, unique result.
{% endhint %}

This section is split between clean and experimental patterns:

* **Clean patterns** represent clarity, harmony, structure, and refinement.
* **Experimental patterns** are to express identity, show cultural energy, and visualise controlled chaos.

Together, these two sets cover the full range of modern web aesthetics recently seen across all top-tier design inspiration platforms.

#### Color Use Patterns

* Neutral bases (white, cream, grey)

#### Composition & Layout Patterns

* Controlled chaos (not random)
* Intentional asymmetry
* Breaking the grid, but with logic
* Layering: text over images, patterns over blocks
* Nonstandard proportions: huge heroes, tiny captions
* Zine/editorial spreads as inspiration

Rule: asymmetry must feel intentional, not sloppy.

Examples: [fantasticman.com](http://fantasticman.com/) ·[ middleplane.com](http://middleplane.com/) ·[ negeurra.com](http://negeurra.com/) ·[ txtbooks.us](http://txtbooks.us/) ·[ ](http://julesesick.com/)[julesesick.com](http://julesesick.com)

#### Color Use Patterns

* Color chosen for emotion, not safety
* Unexpected combinations
* Neon + neutral hybrids
* Monochrome tints
* Dark/light extremes
