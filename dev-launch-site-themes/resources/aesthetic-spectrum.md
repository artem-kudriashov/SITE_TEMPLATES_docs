### Brutalist/art-driven/experimental

Bold, raw, culturally expressive design with controlled chaos and artistic intent.

#### Extended Definition

Brutalist/experimental aesthetics break conventional rules on purpose.&#x20;

Typography becomes an object. Layouts become collages. Noise, grain, glitches, rough textures, poster-like compositions, misalignments, extreme proportions - all of it is intentional. It’s the opposite of safe design: it’s expressive, cultural, editorial, post-internet, and often provocative.

The key is intentionality; nothing here is sloppy, and everything serves an artistic idea.

* avant-garde fashion
* art collectives
